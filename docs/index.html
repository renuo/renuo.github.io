      <h2>What is the Tech Radar?</h2>
      <h4>
        The Renuo Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called
        <i>ring assignment</i>. We use four rings with the following semantics:

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Adopt</h3>
          Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our
          Renuo production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Trial</h3>
          Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience
          that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in
          our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Assess</h3>
          Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and
          prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new
          and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and
          promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Hold</h3>
          Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest
          in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
