  <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

  <p>
    The Renuo Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called
    <i>ring assignment</i>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>ADOPT</b> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with
      a usage culture in our Renuo production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
    <li>
      <b>TRIAL</b> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious
      usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some
      engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
    <li>
      <b>ASSESS</b> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to
      invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they
      are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the
      technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
    <li>
      <b>HOLD</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet)
      worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for
      existing projects.</li>
  </ul>
